 Each dataset was stored in a CSV format where each line represented a single commit.
 
  Every dataset contains a commit for each row such that each commit had various associated features as well as a binary label indicating whether it is risky (label=1) or not risky (label=0). 
  
  
  
  
\subsubsection{Reconstruction Accuracy}

\rqgraphsIter{images/Results/RQ1/Exp3/Myling/recon_acc.png}{images/Results/RQ1/Exp3/JDT/recon_acc.png}{Reconstruction accuracy}{rq1exp3reconstAccuracy}

The reconstruction accuracy in \ref{fig:rq1exp3reconstAccuracy} appears to have very little variance unlike what is being shown in figure \ref{fig:rq1exp3reconstAccuracyJDT}. The reconstruction recall appears to decrease and then increase again as more iterations occur implying that more iterations will not necessarily lead to better predictions for the self-training algorithm. 

\subsubsection{Reconstruction Precision}

\subsubsection{Reconstruction Recall}

\rqgraphsIter{images/Results/RQ1/Exp3/Myling/recon_rec.png}{images/Results/RQ1/Exp3/JDT/recon_rec.png}{Reconstruction recall}{rq1exp3reconstRecall}

The reconstruction recall in figure \ref{fig:rq1exp3reconstRecall} varies a lot, ranging from 0.77 to 0.94.
